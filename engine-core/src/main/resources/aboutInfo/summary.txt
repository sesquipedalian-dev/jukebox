This is a learning project for Scott.  A simple game engine built on the following main components:
- JavaFX 8 drives the UI / graphics canvas
- Scalafx is a scala wrapper around javafx that provides some nicer DSL syntax and such
- Scalego entity-component system in scala, for representing the game entities / scene graph, and providing
  serialization of same. I modified this library to allow for multiple Components within any System (e.g.
  we have a generic Updater system that receives a callback on game ticks; entities can have multiple of these
  and they'll all get called).

Additionally, the engine can load in various modules to play a specific game.

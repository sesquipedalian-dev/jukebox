This is a learning project for Scott.  A simple game engine built on the following main components:
- JavaFX 8 drives the UI / graphics canvas
- Scalafx is a scala wrapper around javafx that provides some nicer DSL syntax and such
- Scalego entity-component system in scala, for representing the game entities / scene graph, and providing
  serialization of same

Additionally, the engine can load in various modules to play a specific game.
